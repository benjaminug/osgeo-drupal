Anyone else on here using LDAP with D7 or have a minute to try it out  
on your own test machine to see if it works?  LDAP is a mystery to me  
on the best of the days
We have the theme developed for D6 but I tried for a few hours last  
night to get it to work with D7 and no luck (boy, I'm tired of  
checklists for the rest of the year!).

Worked pretty good on D6 though it was really confusing because we had  
5 menu blocks on the main page and then had to hide them on subsequent  
pages.  Ugh...

If anyone is interested in helping with this migration, it would be  
awesome support.  We have a web site management committee mailing list  
you could join too if interested in flexing your Drupal muscles.  We  
are in need :)

Suggestions welcome, thanks all.
